0.9: 
Added an auto-updater. Also added Friends Page menu link.
Also added prefs pane to set if update on login check should
occur, as well as allowing users to change server URL.

0.8: 3 April 2006
Added strikethrough to toolbar. Added list of friends to the
LJ User toolbar button. Added offline user information (list
of friends, journals, picture keywords and friend groups) to
the XML configuration (to reload if working offline). Added 
non-working ability to restrict posting to friend group
visibility (ACLs, basically). Also, clear friends, groups,
journals and posting pictures when we get those back when
the user logs in (useful if another person uses your client
and then you find their stuff in your profile). Changed
default extension from .txt to .jrnl as it's XML, not text.
Also added a Communications form to show the user what's 
happening when we talk to the server.

0.7: 16 Feb 2006
Added advanced tab with options like "Mark entry as backdated", 
"Don't email comments", "Don't autoformat to HTML", and 
"Screen comments". Also added grabbing and using the list of 
picture keywords (although at this time I'm not able to load the 
pictures themselves). Also, a basic toolbar with bold, italic, 
underline, link, image and LJUser buttons were added. Resize 
according to the input panel.

Fixed the bug where posting would disable the form permanently

hitting cancel on the save draft file dialog would still clear 
the screen.

Added support for moods. Added support for tags.
