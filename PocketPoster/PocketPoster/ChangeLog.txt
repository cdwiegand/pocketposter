Added strikethrough to toolbar. Added list of friends to the
LJ User toolbar button. Added offline user information (list
of friends, journals, picture keywords and friend groups).
Added non-working ability to restrict posting to friend group
visibility (ACLs, basically).

Added advanced tab with options like "Mark entry as backdated", 
"Don't email comments", "Don't autoformat to HTML", and 
"Screen comments". Also added grabbing and using the list of 
picture keywords (although at this time I'm not able to load the 
pictures themselves). Also, a basic toolbar with bold, italic, 
underline, link, image and LJUser buttons were added. Resize 
according to the input panel.
